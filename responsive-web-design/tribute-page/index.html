          Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 –
          27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
          known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
          general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is believed by
          some to be the first to recognise that the machine had applications
          beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
          intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is
          often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of
          computers and as one of the first computer programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of
          Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian
          engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage's
          lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in
          the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842. Babbage's
          friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate
          Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with
          notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the
          better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage.
          These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then
          published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs
          under the initialism AAL.

        <ul>
          <li>Ada Lovelace is regerder as one of first programmers</li>
          <li>
            Ada Lovelace is regarded as the first to recognise the full
            potential of computer
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ada Lovelace described an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to
          compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published
          algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer,
          and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer
          for this reason. The engine was never completed so her program was
          never tested.
