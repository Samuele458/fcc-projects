        <h2>Who is Ada Lovelace?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Augusta Ada King</strong>, Countess of Lovelace was an English
          mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles
          Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical
          Engine. She is believed by some to be the first to recognise that the
          machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have
          published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a
          machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise
          the full potential of computers and as
          <strong>one of the first computer programmers</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1840, <strong>Babbage</strong> was invited to give a seminar at the
          University of Turin about his Analytical Engine.
          <strong>Luigi Menabrea</strong>, a young Italian engineer and the
          future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage's lecture into
          French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the
          Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842. Babbage's friend
          Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's
          paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which
          were added to the translation. <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> spent the
          better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage.
          These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then
          published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs
          under the initialism AAL.

        <h4>To sum up...</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> is regerder as one of first
            programmers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> is regarded as the first to recognise
            the full potential of computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            She described an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute
            Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the
            <strong> first published algorithm </strong> ever specifically
            tailored for implementation on a computer.
